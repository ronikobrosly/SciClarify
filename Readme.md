**OVERVIEW:**

SciClarify is a Python-based app I created for the 2015 Insight Data science Program. Using the PUBMED 
API, natural language processing, and the random forest algorithm, SciClarify compares your text against the recent top papers in your field by analyzing the following:

* A syllable count
* Number of commas
* Average Sentence length
* The estimated reading level
* Jargony word use
* Subjectivity of text
* ...and much more more!

The fully-functioning app can be found at www.sciclarify.com
